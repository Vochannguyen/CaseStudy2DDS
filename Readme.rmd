# Case Study 02 - Employee Attrition for DDSAnalytics

## Introduction and Purpose
DDSAnalytics company is specializing in talent management for Fortune 100 companies. We, as data scientists, are going leverage our talents and skill for their talent management department. The executive leadership has identified predicting employee turnover, and we will be creating a model to predict attrition. Additionally, we will be using a selection model to predict salary based on our predictor variables.

## Datasets
The Attrition dataset contains a list of 870 employees with 36 possible predictor variables.

## Task #1 - Building an Prediction Attrition model using NB
We will be predicting Attrition using a NB Model.

## Conclusion
In our data analysis, we have analyzed the datasets of Brew and Breweries focused on the alcohol contents(ABV) and bitterness(IBU) in the United States. In our KNN model, we decided to include our N/A using the impute functions. We chose the KNN model because of the inexpensiveness, popularity, and effectiveness with high accuracy. We introduced the classification model of beer types using ABV and IBU values and verified with beer samples in the market including Budweiser. We suggested in making IPAs for Budweiser because we use the average IBU and ABV values in our KNN model to predict IPA. We noticed that there could be a bias in our model. The top three breweries could possibly make more IPAs. 
In our data analysis, we have analuzed the datasets for Attrition for DDSAnalytics company, which did not contain nay NA values. We found that the three most influential factors were monthly income, job roles, and overtime using a forward selection model of all the variables. We chose to go with the Naive Bayes model, which yielded 89% accuracy, 89% Sensitivity, and 84% Specificity. We then created a prediction values based on our model for Attrition. Our second task was to create a
